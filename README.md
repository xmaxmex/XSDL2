# XSDL2
XSDL2 - VB6 Wrapper for SDL2

# About VB6 Wrapper
The wrapper provides bindings for the following libraries:
- SDL2 (2.0.12)
- SDL2_image (2.0.5)

# Note
Please, Note that XSDL2 will not provide every single SDL2 function. This is due to limitations in the VB6 language that would cause major conflicts with the native SDL2 library and its extensions.
